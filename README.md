# DoraHacks_Hackathon_ShareEnergy
##### Problem Statement: Renewable Energy & Smart Power
We are at the cusp of a radical transformation of our existing fossil fuel-based infrastructure to a renewable
energy-based infrastructure. For example, Sweden and Denmark currently run on -50% solar, wind, and hydro
power and have committed to 100% renewable energy by 2040. This "new industrial revolution" will
fundamentally transform the way we store, trade, and use energy, and will be supported by a new industry of
machine-to-machine interactions and autonomous networks.
###### Challenge:
Assume user has extra renewable energy, such as electricity generated by solar panel on his/her house roof. Design a system to trade these extra energy resources. These resource data might be stored on different blockchains.
###### Outcome:
Developed a web based decentralized and transparent application where individual/organization can share and buy extra renewable energy from others.
